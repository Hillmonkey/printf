2 out of 2 points - [_printf] Ask another student what happens when a user calls their function like this: `_printf("hello %s\n", "world", 1, 2, 3, 4);` The student should explain the behavior of the function. What should it print? Will it fail? Answer is: the function has no way to know that more arguments were passed, so it will just ignore them. The function will not fail. The user is responsible for calling the function the right way.
