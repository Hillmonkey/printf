# read in the variadic list of variables - these are what will be pasted into the
	print string.

# read a character at a time from the format-string.
	# if you encounter a placeholder (one %, not two)
		# read following character(s) and compare it to the list of characters
			in your array of structs.
		(it's more complicated for the extra credit stuff where there can be multiple
		characters that specify formatting)
		deal with multiple consecutive %'s eventually
		#??? pass counter as a pointer to op_code functions
	# for each printable character, increment line counter

if in doubt test the functionality of the real printf to see how it should work
